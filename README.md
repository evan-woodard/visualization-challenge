A project exploring the effectiveness of various cancer treatments on mice

In this project, I looked at various drug regimens used to treat cancer in mice.  As seen herewithin, I analyzed the data to parse such inquiries as:

    How did the various drugs affect the tumor volume over time?
    
    Which drugs kept the mice alive the longest?
    
    What does the tumor size arc look like over the measured timepoints of the study?
    
    Is there a correlation between the size of the mice and the the size of the tumors?
    
Some observations of the data are:

    1. Ramicane and Capomulin had the most timepoints by a decently large margin.  An implication of this observation is that the mice lived longer on these regimens.
    2. The box plot of tumor volume at the final timepoint shows that Ramicane and Capomulin were noteably lower than those of the other two I comapared them with.  This could be that the mice on these regimens started with lower volumes.  If all starting tumor volumes were the same, it would signify that these two regimens outperformed the others by a significant margin
    3. The scatter plot indicates that there isn't a correlation between the ceiling of tumor size as it pertains to mouse weight, but there is a lower limit.  The more a mouse weighs, the hgher the floor is for how voluminous the tumor is.
